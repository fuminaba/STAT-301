    "## Dataset Metadata \n",
    "The dataset that is used in this project is known as the `Census Income` dataset, a dataset to predict whether an individual makes over $50,000 per year. This dataset was donated on April 30, 1996 to the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult). The data was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database according to some criterion.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 15 variables including the target variable. \n",
    "| Variable Name | Description | Type of Variable | \n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| `age` | Age of individual | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `workclass` | Categorical variable describing individuals' working class | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `fnlwgt` | Unknown | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `education` | Describes the education level of an individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `education-num` | Numerical description of education level | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `marital-status` | Married, not-married etc. of the individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `occupation` | General description of individuals' job | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `relationship` | Relationship status of individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `race` | Race of individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `sex` | Sex of individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",
    "| `capital-gain` | Capital gain of individual | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `capital-loss` | Capital loss of an individual | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `hours-per-week` | Hours worked per week | Feature, Integer | \n",
    "| `native-country` | Native country of individual | Feature, Categorical | \n",

    "\n",
    "Further detailed description is available at the [dataset link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of variables, some of which may be redundant. For instance, `education` is a categorical feature to describe the education level, whereas `education-num` is an integer which also describes the education level. There is likely a need to perform a feature-selection process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables that seem to be most helpful at the moment are features such as `hours-per-week`, `capital-gain`, `capital-loss` since a person's annual income is a function of the monetary rate and hours worked. However, monetary rate (hourly wage for example) does not seem to be included as a feature. "
